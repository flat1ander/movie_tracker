# Matt's Movie Tracker
## Introduction to App
Welcome to Matt's Movie Tracker! Movie tracker is a fully functional CRUD application that allows you to create, read, update and delete movies that are stored in an sql database. The index page is a collection of dvd covers with the title of the movie underneath the card image. Clicking the card will bring you to a detail page where you can add individual cast/crew information for the movie that you are viewing.
